COMPARING CHANGES WITH GIT DIFF
Diffing is a function that takes two input data sets and outputs the changes between them. git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more. The git diff command is often used along with git status and git log to analyze the current state of a Git repo.

If we execute git diff at this point, there will be no output. This is expected behavior as there are no changes in the repo to diff. Once modified, we can view a diff and analyze the output. Now executing git diff will produce the following output:

	diff --git a/diff_test.txt b/diff_test.txt
	index 6b0c6cf..b37e70a 100644
	--- a/diff_test.txt
	+++ b/diff_test.txt
	@@ -1 +1 @@
	-this is a git diff test example
	+this is a diff example

Let us now examine a more detailed breakdown of the diff output.

	1. Comparison input
	diff --git a/diff_test.txt b/diff_test.txt

This line displays the input sources of the diff. We can see that a/diff_test.txt and b/diff_test.txt have been passed to the diff.

	2. Meta data
	index 6b0c6cf..b37e70a 100644

This line displays some internal Git metadata. You will most likely not need this information. The numbers in this output correspond to Git object version hash identifiers.

	3. Markers for changes
	--- a/diff_test.txt
	+++ b/diff_test.txt

These lines are a legend that assigns symbols to each diff input source. In this case, changes from a/diff_test.txt are marked with a --- and the changes from b/diff_test.txt are marked with the +++ symbol.

	4. Diff chunks
	The remaining diff output is a list of diff 'chunks'. A diff only displays the sections of the file that have changes. 	In our current example, we only have one chunk as we are working with a simple scenario. Chunks have their own granular 	output semantics.

	@@ -1 +1 @@
	-this is a git diff test example
	+this is a diff example

The first line is the chunk header. Each chunk is prepended by a header inclosed within @@ symbols. The content of the header is a summary of changes made to the file. In our simplified example, we have -1 +1 meaning line one had changes. In a more realistic diff, you would see a header like:

	@@ -34,6 +34,8 @@

In this header example, 6 lines have been extracted starting from line number 34. Additionally, 8 lines have been added starting at line number 34. 

The remaining content of the diff chunk displays the recent changes. Each changed line is prepended with a + or - symbol indicating which version of the diff input the changes come from. As we previously discussed, - indicates changes from the a/diff_test.txt and + indicates changes from b/diff_test.txt
