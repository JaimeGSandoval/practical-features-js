GIT PUSH WORKFLOW

The following example describes one of the standard methods for publishing local contributions to the central repository. First, it makes sure your local main is up-to-date by fetching the central repositoryâ€™s copy and rebasing your changes on top of them. The interactive rebase is also a good opportunity to clean up your commits before sharing them. Then, the git push command sends all of the commits on your local main to the central repository.

	git checkout main
	git fetch origin main
	git rebase -i origin/main
	# Squash commits, fix up commit messages etc.
	git push origin main

Since we already made sure the local main was up-to-date, this should result in a fast-forward merge, and git push should not complain about any of the non-fast-forward issues discussed above.
